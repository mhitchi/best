Portfolio site for Best Wood Studio and Workshop.

# client background and needs
Tate and Will are creative woodworkers in Chattanooga, TN. They receive most of their commissions by word of mouth, so their primary needs for a website are not for lead retrieval, but for coallation and showcasing of their works.

# prompt
Clients request a static site that serves randomized images from their portfolio layered in a random fashion in tandem with descriptor text about their business. They'd like for there to be mouse interaction, including interaction with a spinning 3d model of one of their pieces.

Horizontal scroll is central to their design vision.

The necessary pages include:

* homepage
* what's best (about)
* best case scenario (case studies)
* best friends (testimonials)

# keywords
interactive
playful
captures identity more than just work
bauhaus vibes

# technologies
I believe the simplest instance of this site will require React.js, Node.js, Webpack, HTML, CSS, Three.js.
